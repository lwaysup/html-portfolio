<h3>Life Is Beautiful</h3>
<p>I love that it plays with your emotions. It makes you cry and laugh at the same time.</p>
<h3>In The Mood For Love</h3>
<p>A stunningly beautiful and romantic movie where time elapses through the dresses of the female protagonist.</p>
<h3>L'Ete Meurtrier</h3>
<p>Impeccable acting by French actress Isabelle Adjani. The story of a sultry and calculating young woman out to avenge a defining family trauma.</p>
